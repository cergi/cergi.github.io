<p>I am a Sophomore at <a href="http://www.home.bju.edu">Bob Jones University.</a> I am studying Biblical Counseling, and also perform for the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/330179307322280/">BJU Concert Choir.</a> I enjoy spending time with my lovely boyfriend and his family, as well as my family. I love to serve the Lord with the praise team at my local church. I also enjoy performing special music with my father.</a>.</p>
<p>Currently, I reside in Ohio with my family. I have three siblings: a sister in high school, a brother in middle school and another sister in pre-school. My parents also attended and graduated from Bob Jones University. </p>
<p>I hope to use my degree to serve women and win souls over for the Lord through evangelical ministry. </p>
